## Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is JosÃ©
#### Junior web developer


I'm JosÃ© Arriaga from MÃ©xico. I really enjoy learning languages and frameworks like React and I'm also learning Vue.js. But I'm a backend guy, I like optimizing code performance and dealing with data, I felt like the logic flow of the backend is easy to me.

Skills: REACT / JS / HTML / CSS / NODE.JS
